## Module 1 Homework

## Docker & SQL

In this homework we'll prepare the environment 
and practice with Docker and SQL


## Question 1. Knowing docker tags

Run the command to get information on Docker 

```docker --help```

Now run the command to get help on the "docker build" command:

```docker build --help```

Do the same for "docker run".

Which tag has the following text? - *Automatically remove the container when it exits* 

- `--delete`
- `--rc`
- `--rmc`
- `--rm`


## Question 2. Understanding docker first run 

Run docker with the python:3.9 image in an interactive mode and the entrypoint of bash.
Now check the python modules that are installed ( use ```pip list``` ). 

What is version of the package *wheel* ?

- 0.42.0
- 1.0.0
- 23.0.1
- 58.1.0


# Prepare Postgres

Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos
We'll use the green taxi trips from September 2019:

```wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz```

You will also need the dataset with zones:

```wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv```

Download this data and put it into Postgres (with jupyter notebooks or with a pipeline)

### Using a Pipeline

Build the image

```bash
docker build -t taxi_ingest:v001 .
```

Run the script with Docker

```bash
URL="https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz"

docker run -it --rm \
  --network=pg-network \
  taxi_ingest:v001 \
    --user=root \
    --password=root \
    --host=pgdatabase \
    --port=5432 \
    --db=ny_taxi \
    --table_name=green_taxi_trips \
    --url=${URL}
```

```bash
URL="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv"

docker run -it --rm \
  --network=pg-network \
  taxi_ingest:v001 \
    --user=root \
    --password=root \
    --host=pgdatabase \
    --port=5432 \
    --db=ny_taxi \
    --table_name=zones \
    --url=${URL}
```



## Question 3. Count records 

How many taxi trips were totally made on September 18th 2019?

Tip: started and finished on 2019-09-18. 

Remember that `lpep_pickup_datetime` and `lpep_dropoff_datetime` columns are in the format timestamp (date and hour+min+sec) and not in date.

- 15767
- 15612
- 15859
- 89009

### Answer

```bash
select count(1) from
public.green_taxi_trips
where 
lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2019-09-18' and
lpep_dropoff_datetime::DATE <= '2019-09-18'
```

## Question 4. Largest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the largest trip distance
Use the pick up time for your calculations.

- 2019-09-18
- 2019-09-16
- 2019-09-26
- 2019-09-21

### Answer

```bash
select 
lpep_pickup_datetime,
lpep_dropoff_datetime,
(lpep_dropoff_datetime - lpep_pickup_datetime) AS time_distance
from
public.green_taxi_trips
order by time_distance DESC
limit 1
```

## Question 5. Three biggest pick up Boroughs

Consider lpep_pickup_datetime in '2019-09-18' and ignoring Borough has Unknown

Which were the 3 pick up Boroughs that had a sum of total_amount superior to 50000?
 
- "Brooklyn" "Manhattan" "Queens"
- "Bronx" "Brooklyn" "Manhattan"
- "Bronx" "Manhattan" "Queens" 
- "Brooklyn" "Queens" "Staten Island"

### Answer

```bash
select 
zpu."Borough", 
sum(gt.total_amount) as sum_total_amount
from
public.green_taxi_trips gt 
inner join public.zones zpu on gt."PULocationID"=zpu."LocationID"
where gt.lpep_pickup_datetime::DATE = '2019-09-18'
group by zpu."Borough"
having sum(gt.total_amount) > 50000
```

## Question 6. Largest tip

For the passengers picked up in September 2019 in the zone name Astoria which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip?
We want the name of the zone, not the id.

Note: it's not a typo, it's `tip` , not `trip`

- Central Park
- Jamaica
- JFK Airport
- Long Island City/Queens Plaza

### Answer

```bash
select 
zpu."Zone" as picku_zone, 
zdo."Zone" as dropout_zone,
gt.tip_amount
from
public.green_taxi_trips gt 
inner join public.zones zpu on gt."PULocationID"=zpu."LocationID"
inner join public.zones zdo on gt."DOLocationID"=zdo."LocationID"
where DATE_PART('year', gt.lpep_pickup_datetime ) = 2019
  and DATE_PART('month', gt.lpep_pickup_datetime ) = 9
  and zpu."Zone" = 'Astoria'
order by gt.tip_amount DESC
limit 1
```

## Terraform

In this section homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.

In your VM on GCP/Laptop/GitHub Codespace install Terraform. 
Copy the files from the course repo
[here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/01-docker-terraform/1_terraform_gcp/terraform) to your VM/Laptop/GitHub Codespace.

Modify the files as necessary to create a GCP Bucket and Big Query Dataset.


## Question 7. Creating Resources

After updating the main.tf and variable.tf files run:

```
terraform apply
```

Paste the output of this command into the homework submission form.

### Output
```bash
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource
actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.demo_dataset will be created

      + url                         = (known after apply)

      + lifecycle_rule {
          + action {
              + type = "AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload"
            }
          + condition {

            }
        }
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

google_bigquery_dataset.demo_dataset: Creating...
